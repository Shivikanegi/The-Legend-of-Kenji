# The Legend of Kenji
A single-page prototype that reimagines a story showcase with a traditional oil‑painted, epic‑fantasy aesthetic: warm golden ochre, deep sunset oranges, soft cherry‑blossom pinks, and dark charcoal / weathered indigo accents. Focuses on painterly textures, golden‑hour lighting, sumi‑e iconography, and lacquered UI chrome.
